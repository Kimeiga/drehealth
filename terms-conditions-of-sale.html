The Customer shall have the right to be present at said weighing, provided the delivery shall not be delayed because of this. The Customer shall take the initiative thereto himself in good time. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">6.4 The Company shall have the right to increase the stated and/or agreed prices in the event of an increase in prices of goods, raw materials or parts to be obtained from third parties, wages, national insurance contributions, freight, insurance premiums or other cost price factors (including changes in foreign exchange) and charges (including import and transit duties). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the event that a price increase takes place within three months after the conclusion of the agreement, the Customer who is also a consumer shall be entitled to dissolve the agreement. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">6.5 In the event that the state d and/or agreed prices are (also) based on restitutions of levies and/or on subsidies, whereas these are not obtained for whatever reason, the Company is entitled to adjust the prices accordingly. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Article 7 - delivery – delivery period – delivery time </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7 .1 Unless explicitly agreed upon otherwise, the delivery shall be made "Ex Works" (EXW) from the premises of the Company. The interpretation of the terms and conditions of deli very shall be determined by the most recent edition at the time of conclusion of the agreement of the Incoterms, as issued by the International Chamber of Commerce. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7.2 The delivery period shall commence at the latest on: </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">- the date of conclusion of the agreement; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">- the date at which the Company has at its disposal all the documents, information, permits, exemptions, approvals, allocations, etc., needed for the delivery of the goods; </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">- the date of receipt of a prepayment by the Company and/or the date of provision of a security the Company is entitled to in accordance with the agreement. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7.3 The delivery period shall be based on the circumstances applicable at the time of conclusion of the agreement and on the timely delivery of the materials and goods ordered by the Company for the execution of the agreement. In the event that any delay arises as a result of changes in these circumstances or because the materials and/or goods timely ordered for the execution of the agreement have not been delivered in time, the delivery period shall be extended to such a degree as is reasonable , taking all circumstances into consideration. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7.4 The delivery date of the goods shall be the moment in time when the goods, with the exception of unimportant parts, are ready for shipment, and the Company has informed the Customer thereof, or the time when the goods have left the premises of the Company to be forwarded to the Customer. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7.5 The Company shall be entitled at all times to make partial deliveries, unless explicitly agreed upon otherwise. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7.6 The delivery date shall not be considered to be a firm date, unless explicitly agreed upon otherwise.
